# Countdown-Gameshow
A digital version of the popular British gameshow Countdown!

# What is Countdown?
This version of Countdown only contains the numbers round. The numbers round has contestants use basic arithmatics to reach a set number. The game starts by choosing six numbers, each number being either a small or a large number. The goal is then set and the contestants have 30 seconds to solve it.

# How does this version work?
Per now, the program doesn't support checking answers from the user. Instead, you tell the program when you think you're done, or when you want to give up, and it shows you all the answer the program found. If it didn't find any, it'll inform you.

# Why is this project so clunky?
Because this is my first free-form python project entirely from scratch. Suggestions are welcome!

Good luck!
